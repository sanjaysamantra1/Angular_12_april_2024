Prototype
---------
-A prototype is an object used to implement structure, state, and behaviour inheritance.
-Prototype is the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
-Prototype is an object, where we can attach methods and properties,which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
-Prototype is a base class for all the objects, and it helps us to achieve inheritance.
-All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
-properties added to the prototype of a class gets available to all the objects of that class.
-prototype should be used When we have to add new properties like variables and methods 
at a later point of time,and these properties needs to be shared across all the instances, 
-a property should be added to the constructor of a class if value of the property changes per object
-a property should be added to the prototype of a class if the value remains same for all objects.



Inheritance
-----------
- Inheritance is the concept where one class inherits the properties
  from another class.
- the class which inherits properties is called child/derived/sub.
  the class which provides the properties is called parent/base/super.
- it is mainly used for code re-usability.
- also called is-a relationship
