Functions 
=========
-function is a block of code/statements designed to perform a particular task.
-function is executed only when that gets invoked/called.

1. pre-defined (alert(),prompt(),confirm(),max(),min(),sqrt(),cbrt())
	already written, we are just using them
2. user-defined
	we have to write,and we will use them   
   a. function declaration (named function)
   b. function expression(anonymous)
   c. self invoked ( IIFE- Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
   d. arrow function (ES - 6)(2015)
  
Arrow Function
--------------
-'this' value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the context in which it is called.
-'this' inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to 'this' where the function is declared.
-lexical context means that arrow function uses 'this' from the code that contains the arrow function.
-Regular function ( this = how the function is invoked/who invoked )
-Arrow function( this = where the function is declared )
